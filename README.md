## Introduction üöÄ

_Black Friday_ is a significant shopping event, and understanding the factors influencing sales can provide valuable insights for both retailers and consumers. In this project, we employ machine learning to predict Black Friday sales based on customer demographics and purchase behavior.

## Dataset Exploration üìä

### Data Overview

The dataset contains information about customers, including their gender, age, marital status, occupation, and purchase details. Exploring and preprocessing the data is the initial step in building an effective predictive model.

### Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and other preprocessing steps are crucial for preparing the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìà

Exploratory Data Analysis involves visualizing and interpreting the dataset to extract meaningful insights. Let's explore some key aspects:

### Data Distributions and Skewness

## General Analysis üìà

The exploratory data analysis reveals interesting insights into customer behavior during Black Friday sales:

- **Gender Impact:** Males exhibit a higher purchasing tendency than females.
- **Occupation Influence:** Occupations with codes 12, 15, and 17 show increased purchasing activity.
- **Age and Marital Status:** Slight female majority is observed in the dataset's marital status distribution.

## Model Development ü§ñ

### Data Preparation

Before building models, we preprocess the data, splitting it into training and testing sets.

### Model Selection
